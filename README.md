# Curseforge Userscripts
Some useful userscripts for curseforge.com. Feel free to PR or create issues for features you want added. They work well with [Curse Dark by its_meow](https://itsmeow.dev/cursedark/).

## Install
To install these userscripts, you will need a supported userscript manager for your browser. I highly recommend Tampermonkey, which is available for all popular browsers:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- [Safari](http://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/tampermonkey/9nblggh5162s)
- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

Once you have installed a userscript manager, click the following links to install userscripts from this repository:

They can also be installed from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/331451-comp500).

## Curseforge Quality Of Life Fixes
This userscript fixes a few annoying problems with Curseforge. If you have any suggestions, please submit them as issues or [ping me on Discord](https://discord.mcmoddev.com/)!

### Features
- Adds a search bar to the top navigation bar that searches mods (and removes the Minecraft Forums link to make space)

	![Search bar](images/searchbar.png)
- Changes the default action of the "Browse" link (in the top navigation bar) and the Minecraft logo on that page to the Mods tab of Minecraft

	![Mods tab](images/modstab.png)
- Adds a tab to mod pages that allows all the files to be viewed, rather than just the recent files - normally hidden behind a "View All" button

- Adds pagination for dependency lists to the bottom of the page, so you don't have to scroll up!

### Upcoming features
I had these extra ideas, I'm going to add them soon.

- Readds modpack download link to the main modpack page, because they removed it for some reason. Saves you a click!
- Automatically follows the 5 second redirect for you, so you don't have to wait.

## Redirect Old Links
When Curseforge redesigned their site, they moved mods from minecraft.curseforge.com to www.curseforge.com/minecraft. It doesn't seem to redirect the old links to the new ones any more, so this userscript will do it for you. For some reason the new site also doesn't support viewing mods by Addon ID anymore, so this script will resolve the IDs if they exist in the old links.

## No More MCreator Mods
This userscript attempts to determine which mods are MCreator mods on the Curseforge site, and hide them! It may cause excessive bandwidth usage (it often downloads the actual mod to check if is a MCreator mod) and is more of an experiment than an actual userscript.

## No More ARR (All Rights Reserved) Mods
This is a variant of No More MCreator Mods, but excluding all mods without a Source link. This has the benefit of being much faster than the above, and also excluding evil closed source mods! (Although some people forget to put a Source link on their mod so....)
